Problem Statement

The average retention rate in the insurance industry is 84%, with the 
top-performing agencies in the 93%-95% range. 
Retaining customers is all about the long-term relationship you build.
Offer a discount on the client's current policy will ensure he/she buys a

Insurance company wants to analyze their customer's behaviour to 
device offers to increase customer loyalty.


CRISP-ML(Q) process model describes six phases:
 
1. Business and Data Understanding
2. Data Preparation
3. Model Building
4. Model Evaluation
5. Deployment
6. Monitoring and Maintenance

Steps to Consider:

Load the Data
Perform EDA and derive insights
Perform Data Preprocessing (steps as appropriate)
Implement Clustering (Hierarchical)
Evaluate the Model - perform tuning by altering hyperparameters - (Silhouette coefficient)
Cluster the Data using the best model (based on the metrics evaluated)
Label the clusters

1st STEP:
1. Business and Data Understanding :


Objective(s): Maximize the Sales 
Constraints: Minimize the Customer Retention

'''Success Criteria'''

Business Success Criteria: Increase the Sales by 10% to 12% by targeting cross-selling opportunities for current customers.

ML Success Criteria: Achieve a Silhouette coefficient of at least 0.6

Economic Success Criteria: The insurance company will see an increase in revenues by at least 8%
